# spring-hibernate-tutorial
A project done while taking the Spring and Hibernate for Beginners course on Udemy. Instead of using Spring + Spring MVC I built the project using Spring Boot and the Thymeleaf templating engine. I am still using Spring MVC however, but have eliminated a lot of the boiler plate by using Spring Boot and Lombok.
